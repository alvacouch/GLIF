#What is GLIF?
Currently GLIF is a Gerber writer written in python. It takes graphical primitives such as lines, arcs, circles, polygons, and ASCII text and writes out valid RS-274X "Gerber" files. These files are typically used to manufacture PCBs.

#Features
 * Working Gerber import and export (import needs work to add support for few more primitives such as Arcs)
