#What is GLIF?
Currently GLIF is a Gerber writer written in python. It takes graphical primitives such as lines, arcs, circles, polygons, and ASCII text and writes out valid RS-274X "Gerber" files. These files are typically used to manufacture PCBs.

#TODO
* Add a Gerber import using the excellent "pcb-tools" project by curtacircuitos
